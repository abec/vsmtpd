# This file specifies the RBL zones list, used by the dnsbl plugin. It has
# no effect unless that plugin is enabled (in /etc/vsmtpd/vsmtpd.cfg). If
# enabled, the IP address of each connecting host will be checked against
# each  zone given.  A few sample DNSBLs are listed here, but you should 
# evaluate the efficacy and listing policies of a DNSBL before using it.
